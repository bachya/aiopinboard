`aiopinboard` is a Python3, `asyncio`-focused library for interacting with
[Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) API.

# Installation

```python
pip install aiopinboard
```

# Python Versions

`aiopinboard` is currently supported on:

* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8 

# API Token

You can retrieve your Pinboard API token via
[your account's settings page](https://pinboard.in/settings/password).

# Usage

`aiopinboard` endeavors to replicate all of the endpoints
[the Pinboard API documentation](https://pinboard.in/api) with sane, usable responses.

All API usage starts with creating an `API` object that contains your Pinboard API token:

```python
import asyncio

from aiopinboard import Client


async def main() -> None:
    api = API("<PINBOARD_API_TOKEN>")
    # do things!


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Getting the Last Change Datetime

To get the UTC datetime of the last "change" (bookmark added, updated, or deleted):

```python
import asyncio

from aiopinboard import Client


async def main() -> None:
    api = API("<PINBOARD_API_TOKEN>")
    last_change_dt = await.async_get_last_change_datetime()
    # >>> datetime.datetime(2020, 9, 3, 13, 7, 19, tzinfo=<UTC>)


asyncio.run(main())
```

This method should be used to determine whether additional API calls should be made â€“
for example, if nothing has changed since the last time a request was made, the
implementing library can halt.

## Delete a Bookmark

To delete a bookmark by its URL:

```python
import asyncio

from aiopinboard import Client


async def main() -> None:
    api = API("<PINBOARD_API_TOKEN>")
    await api.async_delete_bookmark("https://my.com/bookmark")


asyncio.run(main())
```
